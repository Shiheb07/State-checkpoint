You can check my portfolio here (ideally you show them your work directly on the screen of your laptop, but if this is a job application you can just share with them a link to your portfolio). As you can see, I custom-coded a variety of websites, ranging from simple e-shops to complex platforms with a variety of functions. On some of these projects I worked alone, but on some I worked on a team and definitely enjoy teamwork. Except of my work, which is my greatest passion, I enjoy running and cycling. Honestly think it is important to balance the long hours we spend in front of a computer screen with some physical activity, and thatâ€™s exactly what I do in my leisure time. ",
